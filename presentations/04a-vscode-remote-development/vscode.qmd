## Visual Studio Code

VSCode is an editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.

Feature-rich compared to Vi, nano, etc., with extensions for

- Git
- linting
- intelligent code completion
- Remote Development
- and more!

Install Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## SSH {.smaller}

Secure Shell (SSH) is a network communication protocol that allows two computers to communicate, e.g. your laptop and Baskerville.

\

*Pre-requisite:* For VSCode Remote Development to work, you need an SSH Client installed.

\

| OS | Instructions |
| -- | -- |
| Windows 10+ | Install the [Windows OpenSSH Client](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) |
| Earlier Windows | Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) |
| macOS | Comes pre-installed |
| Debian/Ubuntu | Run `sudo apt-get install openssh-client`|
| RHEL/Fedora/CentOS | Run `sudo yum install openssh-clients`|

## Port Forwarding {.smaller}

You might want to run an application on Baskerville that launches a server remotely and view it on your local browser.

\

Port forwarding is a way to redirect the remote application's server address and port to your local browser.

\ 

Run this command on your **local machine**

```bash
ssh -N -L <local_port>:bask-pg0XXXuXXX:<remote_port> baskerville
```

where 

- `bask-pg0XXXuXXX` is the nodename of the Baskerville **compute node** you are running the remote application
- `<local_port>` is any number from 0 to 65353 (that's not already in use)
- `<remote_port>` is the port number your remote application is using (usually able to  manually define this)

## tmux

Using `tmux` on Baskerville allows you to create interactive jobs that you can detach from. If you get disconnected from the cluster, for example by putting your laptop to sleep, your interactive allocation will be terminated and your job killed.

\

With `tmux`, you can detach gracefully and `tmux` will maintain your allocation.

\

*Baskerville is a shared resource. Please don't leave your job idle, and remember to scancel your job when you are finished.*

## Summary

- **VSCode** is a powerful, feature-rich text editor
- VSCode Extensions can aid remote development on Baskerville HPC clusters, such as
  - **Remote - SSH**
  - **Remote explorer**
- **Port forward** to view remote applications in your local web browser
- `tmux` keeps your terminal session alive when your connection to the cluster drops
